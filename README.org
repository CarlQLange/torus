#+STARTUP: showall

* WARNING

This project is in early stage of construction. Meanwhile, see the
[[https://github.com/chimay/mtorus][MTorus]] repository for a usable plugin.


* Introduction

If you ever dreamed about creating and switching buffer groups at will
in emacs, Torus is the tool you want.

This repository is based on MTorus, see the repo here or
https://sourceforge.net/projects/mtorus.berlios/

Note that :

  - A buffer group is called a circle

  - The set of all buffer groups is called the torus (a circle of circles)

In short, this plugin let you organize your buffers by creating as
many buffer groups as you need, and quickly navigate between :

  - Buffers of the same group

  - Buffer groups (circles)


* Configuration

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (require 'torus)

  (torus/init)

  (setq torus/prefix-key (kbd "s-t"))

  (torus/install-default-bindings)

  (setq torus/dirname "~/racine/plugin/data/torus/")

#+end_src


* Warning

I try to be mindful when I code, but some bugs might remain, so be careful.
