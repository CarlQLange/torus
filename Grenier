;; This 'dump-vars-to-file routine will create some expressions that can be read by simply evaluating the expressions later (via a 'load command or 'read):

(defun dump-vars-to-file (varlist filename)
  "simplistic dumping of variables in VARLIST to a file FILENAME"
  (save-excursion
    (let ((buf (find-file-noselect filename)))
      (set-buffer buf)
      (erase-buffer)
      (dump varlist buf)
      (save-buffer)
      (kill-buffer))))

(defun dump (varlist buffer)
  "insert into buffer the setq statement to recreate the variables in VARLIST"
  (loop for var in varlist do
        (print (list 'setq var (list 'quote (symbol-value var)))
               buffer)))

;; I'm sure I'm missing some built-in routine that does a nicer job or is more flexible.

;; I tested it with this little routine:

(defun checkit ()
  (let ((a '(1 2 3 (4 5)))
        (b '(a b c))
        (c (make-vector 3 'a)))
    (dump-vars-to-file '(a b c) "/some/path/to/file.el")))
Which produced the output:

(setq a (quote (1 2 3 (4 5))))
(setq b (quote (a b c)))
(setq c (quote [a a a]))
